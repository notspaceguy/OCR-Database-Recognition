OCR and Database Comparison

Briefing: 
I recently interned at a data analysis startup. I was given the task of developing a program allowing the capture of a picture containing a company name, and printing out certain information about it.

Steps Involved In Running The Program: 
- Capturing a picture
- Detect any text present - expecting to identify the name of a company 
- Compare the text to an SQL table
- Print out the companyâ€™s information if recognized

This Program: 
This is a sample program. It is able to identify 3 companies: Google, Nintendo and Microsoft,
printing out some information about them.
