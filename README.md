OCR and Database Comparison

Briefing: 
During my internship at a data analysis startup, I was asked to develop a program that allows 
you to take a picture of a company name and print out certain information about it.

Steps Involved In Running The Program: 
- Allows you to take a picture
- Detect any text present - expecting to identify the name of a company 
- Compare the text to a table
- Print out the companyâ€™s information if recognized

This Program: 
This is a sample program. It is able to identify 3 companies: Google, Nintendo and Microsoft,  
printing out information about them.
